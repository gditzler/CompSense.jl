    IRLS(A::Matrix{Float64}, b::Vector{Float64}; maxiter=100, epsilon=0.01)

Find the solution to Ax=b using Iterative Recursive Least Squares.

### Input

- `A`       -- Matrix: Ax=b
- `b`       -- Vector: Ax=b
- `maxiter` -- (optional) number of optmization iterations
- `epsilon` -- (optional) threshold to stop optimizing

### Output

Solution to Ax=b (Vector{Float64})

### Example

julia> A = randn(10, 100);
julia> b = randn(10);
julia> x = IRLS(A, b, maxiter=5, epsilon=.01);
julia> println(x)

### Algorithm

This function implements Andrew's monotone chain convex hull algorithm to
