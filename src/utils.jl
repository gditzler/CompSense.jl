    SL0(n::Int64, p::Int64, k::Int64, type::String="Gaussian")

Generate a dataset for compressed sensing. 

### Input

- `n       -- Int64: number of rows 
- `p`      -- Int64: number of columns
- `k`      -- Int64: number true non-zeros
- `type`   -- String: type to generate ["Gaussian"]

### Output
